In order of priority
-Add activation layers
-Add cost functions and their derivatives
-Add a network class for combining layers and doing SGD
-Multilayer testing with actual loss functions and activations
-Add print statements to the tests so we can see the values being compared
-Naive loss is ok for this test but define a function for the gradient for numpynn

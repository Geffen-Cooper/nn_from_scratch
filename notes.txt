getting conda to work with vscode without setting the global path
-vscode should automatically detect the python installed with conda if selected
 "register anaconda3 as default python" on installation
-to be able to use conda in the terminal, you must tell vscode where the conda path
 is, assuming it was not added to the global path. Specify in user settings conda path
-for some reason powershell doesn't recognize conda but cmd will automatically activate conda
 when a new terminal window is opened assuming the python activate env in current terminal is active
-you can also call conda from the cmd terminal since the path is specified in the user settings
-if using a remote machine without vscode, you can install conda and add it to the path using the
 .bashrc. Or you can create a script that adds conda to the path while running a certain program
 so that when the program finishes, it will remove conda from the path.


Network class
-create an abstract base class, all networks should have a forward and a backward function, an add layer function,
  a list of layers, a loss function, and an update parameters function
-when creating a model the constructor needs nothing, to make the model we call the add layer function with
 the constructor of the desired layer, also we need to set a loss function.
-the forward function will take the input batch and call forward on all the layers and then return the raw output
-then we can call the get loss using the labels and the raw output "model.loss(Y_hat,Y)"
-then we call the backward function which will do backprop
-then we can call step which will update all the parameters

getting conda to work with vscode without setting the global path
-vscode should automatically detect the python installed with conda if selected
 "register anaconda3 as default python" on installation
-to be able to use conda in the terminal, you must tell vscode where the conda path
 is, assuming it was not added to the global path. Specify in user settings conda path
-for some reason powershell doesn't recognize conda but cmd will automatically activate conda
 when a new terminal window is opened assuming the python activate env in current terminal is active
-you can also call conda from the cmd terminal since the path is specified in the user settings
-if using a remote machine without vscode, you can install conda and add it to the path using the
 .bashrc. Or you can create a script that adds conda to the path while running a certain program
 so that when the program finishes, it will remove conda from the path.
